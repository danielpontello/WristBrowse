# WristBrowser

WristBrowser is a **very** rudimentary, proof-of-concept Web Browser for the Pebble smartwatch. It can currently render (almost) correctly the contents of [Text-only NPR](http://text.npr.org).

Although I hate JavaScript, I used it to create this project in order to have something running as quick as possible, using the [PebbleJS](https://pebble.github.io/pebblejs/) framework.

## Requirements

- Pebble SDK (Installation instructions can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/pebble/comments/9i9aqy/developing_for_pebble_without_cloudpebble_windows/))

If some file is unavailable, you can find a full backup of Pebble assets [here](https://github.com/aveao/PebbleArchive).

## Building

With the Pebble SDK installed, run the ```build.sh``` script on this folder to build and start the app on an emulator.
